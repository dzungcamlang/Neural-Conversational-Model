# Neural-Conversational-Model
Tensorflow Implementation of Neural Conversational Model by Vinyals et.al. - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869v3.pdf

Uses TFRecords, dynamic_rnn implementation and pretrained word-embeddings. Trained on the excellently formated Cornell Movie Dialogure corpus - http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html

Work In Progress
